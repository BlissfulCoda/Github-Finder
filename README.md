#### Description

- Github Finder provides a full-stack desktop and mobile user interface that utilizes a `Third-party GitHub API` to display personalized user profiles, including their most recent repositories, followers, following, public gist, and location. This is done through various RESTful endpoints, and accessed using a `Forward API Proxy`.
  <br>
- Additionally, the application features a feedback functionality that uses a `Generator Function` to map each individual visitor feedback to a Marvel character's image, name and timestamp.
  <br>

- The primary focus of the application is on the design, functionality, and usability of the user interface. It integrates multiple technologies to provide a seamless user experience.
